<h2>Creating an application that uses WinPcap Professional</h2>
<p>To create an application that uses wpcap.dll with Microsoft Visual C++, 
follow these
steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include the file <i>pcap.h</i> at the beginning of every source file that
    uses the functions exported by library.</li>
  <li>If your program uses Win32 specific functions of WinPcap, remember to include <code>WPCAP</code>
    among the preprocessor definitions.</li>
  <li>If your program uses the remote extensions (<code>pcap_findalldevs_ex()</code> is among the remote extensions), 
	remember to add <code>HAVE_REMOTE</code> among your preprocessor definitions.<li>Set the options of the linker to include the <i>wpcap.lib</i> library
    file. <i>wpcap.lib</i> can
    be found in the \lib folder of the WinPcap Professional developer's pack.
  <li>Set the options of the linker to include the winsock library file (for
    example <i>wsock32.lib</i>). This file is distributed with the C compiler
    and contains the socket functions for Windows. It is needed by some <code>libpcap</code>
    functions.</li>
	<li>Initialize WinPcap Professional before calling *any* pcap function by calling 
	<a href=group__wpcapfunc.html#ga64><code>pcap_start_oem</code></a>. Here is 
	some sample code you may use:</li>
	<br>
&nbsp;<div class="fragment">char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];<br>
		...<br>
		if (pcap_start_oem(errbuf, 0) == -1)<br>
		{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf(&quot;Error initializing WinPcap Professional: %s\n&quot;, errbuf);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit(1);<br>
		}</div>
	&nbsp;<li>Place the WinPcap Professional DLLs available in the \bin folder of the 
	developer's pack into the working directory of your application.<br>
	<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> in order to avoid conflicts with any existing 
	installation of WinPcap, you should avoid putting the WinPcap Professional DLLs in 
	the system folder (usually c:\windows\system32) or generally in a folder on 
	your PATH.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember that</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To add a preprocessor definition, you must select <em>Settings</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu, then select <em>C/C++</em>
    from the tab control, and under the category <i>General</i>, you must add
    the definition under the Preprocessor Definitions text box.
  <li>To add a new library to the project with Microsoft Visual C++, you must
    select <em>Settings</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu, then select <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, and then add the name of the new library in the <em>Object/library
    modules</em>  editbox.
  <li>To add a new path where Microsoft Visual C++ will look for the libraries,
    you must select <em>Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, then <em>
	Directories</em>
    from the tab control, <em>Library files</em> from the <em>Show directories
    for</em>  combobox, and the add the path in the <em>Directories</em> box.
  <li>To add a new path where Microsoft Visual C++ will look for include files, you must select <em>Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, then 
	<em>Directories</em>
    from the tab control, <em>Include files</em> from the <em>Show directories
    for</em>  combobox, and the add the path in the <em>Directories</em> box.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deploying WinPcap Professional in your application installation</h2>
<p>Installing WinPcap Professional with your application is extremely easy: you should 
just copy the DLLs available in the \bin folder of the developer's pack (i.e. 
packet.dll and wpcap.dll) into the working directory of your application. </p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: </b>in order to avoid conflicts with any existing installation of 
WinPcap, you should avoid putting the WinPcap Professional DLLs in the system folder 
(usually c:\windows\system32) or generally in a folder on your PATH.</p>
<h2>Sample programs</h2>
<p>A couple of sample programs are provided to show the usage of the WinPcap API. The
source of the examples, along with all the files needed to compile and run them, can be found in the Developer's
Pack of WinPcap Professional. For didactic purpose we provide here a browsable version of 
the code: it is possible to click on the variables and functions to jump the 
documentation of each of them. For a more complete set of samples, please refer 
to the <a href="group__wpcap__tut.html">WinPcap Professional
Tutorial Section</a>.</p>
