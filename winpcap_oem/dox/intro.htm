<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>This Manual describes the
programming interface of WinPcap Professional. It provides detailed
descriptions of the functions and structures exported to programmers, along
with several tutorials and
examples.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>You can follow the links at the top of this page to reach sections of interest.

</p>
<h2>What is WinPcap</h2>
<p>WinPcap is an open source library for packet capture and network analysis for 
the Win32 platforms.</p>
<p>Most networking applications access the network through widely used operating 
system primitives such as sockets.&nbsp; It is easy to access data on the 
network with this approach since the operating system copes with the low level 
details (protocol handling, packet reassembly, etc.) and provides a familiar 
interface that is similar to the one used to read and write files.

</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the 'easy way' is not up to the task, since some 
applications require direct access to packets on the network.&nbsp; That is, they 
need access to the &quot;raw&quot; data on the network without the interposition of 
protocol processing by the operating system. </p>
<p>The purpose of WinPcap is to give this kind of access to Win32 applications; 
it provides facilities to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>capture
    raw packets, both the ones destined to the machine where it's running and
    the ones exchanged by other hosts (on shared media)</li>
	<li>filter
    the packets according to user-specified rules before dispatching them to the
    application</li>
	<li>transmit raw packets to the network</li>
	<li>gather statistical information on the network traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of capabilities is obtained by means of a device driver, that is 
installed inside the networking portion of Win32 kernels, plus a couple of DLLs.</p>
<p>All these features are exported through a powerful programming interface, 
easily exploitable by the applications and available on different OSes. The main 
goal of this manual is to document this interface, with the help of several 
examples.&nbsp; If you are interested in starting your exploration right away 
you can go directly to the <a href="group__wpcap.html">WinPcap user's manual</a>.</p>
<h3>What is WinPcap Professional</h3>
<p>WinPcap Professional is a customized version of WinPcap, 
specifically tailored for companies needing to embed the WinPcap technology 
inside their applications. Here are the main features of WinPcap Professional:</p>
<ul>
	<li>no installation required.</li>
	<li>easy to include in third party applications (you 
	just put the WinPcap Professional DLLs in the same folder of your application).</li>
	<li>no conflicts with versions of WinPcap previously 
	installed on the target machine, since WinPcap Professional loads its own drivers.</li>
	<li>loads the driver when the user starts your 
	application, unloads the driver when the user closes your application.</li>
	<li>support for 
<ul>
	<li>Windows NT4</li>
	<li>Windows 2000</li>
	<li>Windows XP (x86 and x64)</li>
	<li>Windows Server 2003 (x86 and x64)</li>
	<li>Windows Server 2003 R2 (x86 and x64)</li>
	<li>Windows Vista (x86 and x64).</li>
	<li>Windows Server 2008 (x86 and x64).</li>
	<li>Windows 7 (x86 and x64).</li>
	<li>Windows Server 2008 R2 (x86 and x64).</li>
</ul>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>Including WinPcap Professional in your application and deploying it in your installer 
is extremely easy, just follow the instructions in section
<a href="group__wpcapsamps.html">Using WinPcap Professional in your 
programs</a>.</p>

<h3>What kind of programs use WinPcap</h3>
<p>The WinPcap programming interface can be used by many types of network tools 
for analysis, troubleshooting, security and
monitoring. In particular, classical tools that rely on WinPcap are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>network and protocol analyzers</li>
  <li>network monitors</li>
  <li>traffic loggers</li>
  <li>traffic generators</li>
  <li>user-level bridges and routers</li>
  <li>network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)</li>
  <li>network scanners</li>
  <li>security tools</li>
</ul>
<h3>What WinPcap cannot do</h3>
<p>WinPcap receives and sends the packets <i>independently</i> from the host 
protocols, like TCP-IP. This means that it isn't able to block, filter or 
manipulate the traffic generated by other programs on the same machine: it 
simply &quot;sniffs&quot; the packets that transit on the wire. Therefore, it does not 
provide the appropriate support for applications like traffic shapers, QoS 
schedulers and personal firewalls. </p>

<h2>Purpose of this manual</h2>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to provide a comprehensive and easy way to 
browse the documentation of the WinPcap architecture.</p>
<p>The Manual contains all the information about functions and data 
structures exported by the WinPcap API, a manual that explains how to write 
packet filters and a page that explains how to include it in an application. A 
tutorial with several code samples is provided as well; it can be used to learn 
the basics of the WinPcap API using a step-by-step approach, but it also offers 
code snippets that demonstrate advanced features. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Additional Documentation</h2>
<p>For additional and up-to-date documentation, we suggest that you look at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/docs/">http://www.winpcap.org/docs/</a>
</p>
<p>In particular, if you are interested in
the structure and the internals of WinPcap, we suggest reading the
following documents:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>For consistency with the literature, we will use the term <i>packet</i> even
    though <i>frame</i> is more accurate since the capture process is done at 
	the data-link layer and the data-link header is included in the captured 
	data.</p>
